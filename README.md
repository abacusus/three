# 🌐 Three.js 
Three.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library that makes it easier to create and display 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.
Three.js is a wrapper around WebGL, which is the low-level graphics API supported by modern browsers. WebGL can be complex and verbose. Three.js provides a simpler, more developer-friendly interface.
